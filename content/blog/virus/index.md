## Yes, I am using COVID-19 as a metaphor

At this point, it would be weird if I wrote anything that wasn't about the current global pandemic. But as far as assessing the impact of the actual virus, I think its too early to make any accurate predictions. But obviously, I haven't forgotten about it.

## Signs that you might have been infected by the Stupidity virus

-   Debating the relative merits of Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer (if British) or Donald Trump and Joe Biden (if American).
-   Being a partisan hack for the "left" or "right" party in your nation's politics.
-   Endorsing the "front runner" of your party, like their victory would have any actual impact on ordinary people's lives.
-   Saying that you have "Never Kissed A Tory" (if British) or "Vote Blue, No Matter Who" (if American).
-   Substituting real policy advocacy for being a partisan hack.
-   Going from "UBI" or "End The Wars" to "Vote For Joe Biden".
-   Lucrative TV punditry.
-   Book deals.

## Disease vectors for political stupidity

-   Blue check-mark accounts on Twitter
-   Ugly people in pubs and bars
-   Taxi drivers
-   Talk Radio
-   TV News

## What to do if you are becoming a partisan hack

-   Disavow candidates who have let you down
-   Delete your Facebook acount
-   Step away from the election coverage
-   Slap yourself really hard for being a chump
-   Remind yourself that changing the political consensus in your country is more likely to create lasting change because that's not dependent on "your candidate" winning every election.
